# Algorithms Practice for QA Automation & Technical Interviews

This repository is a structured collection of **algorithm exercises written in JavaScript**, designed to strengthen logical reasoning, data structures understanding, and problem-solving skills commonly evaluated in **QA Automation**, **SDET**, and **Software Engineering** interviews.

The repository is organized into **10 core algorithm categories**, each containing **20 exercises** with increasing difficulty.  
The goal is to train loop control, conditionals, string/array manipulation, hash maps, mathematical logic, and classic interview patterns.

---

## 🧪 **Exercise Format**

Each exercise file (example: `exercise-07.js`) includes:

- Problem statement
- Manual loop-based solution
- Optional optimized solution
- Console example for testing

---

## 🧠 **Purpose of This Repository**

This repo is designed to help practice:

- Algorithmic thinking
- Mastery of loops and conditional logic
- Manual manipulation without built-ins (as required in interviews)
- Problem-solving patterns for QA Automation interviews
- Confidence for live-coding sessions

It is also ideal to display on GitHub as part of a portfolio for recruiters or interviewers.
